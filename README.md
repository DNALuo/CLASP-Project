The pipline that we designed: 
1) Person and bin detections from Faster-RCNN (repo:https://github.com/longcw/faster_rcnn_pytorch)
2) Multi-person pose estimitions from Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation (repo:https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation)
3) Action Recognition from ACT detector (repo: https://github.com/vkalogeiton/caffe/tree/act-detector/act-detector-scripts)
